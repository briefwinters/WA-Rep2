  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project outlines my process using Stasis Theory to look in-depth at Pittsburgh's industrial history. I used an online repository run by Pitt to gather information on the subject. The primary focus of my asset was an early coal company with many operations in the Pittsburgh area. This provided valuable insight into the inside operations that built the region up industrially. Below are some of the images I used as references to better understand the local area's coal fields and idustrial endeavours.</p>

  <h2>Background - Pittsburgh's Industrial History</h2>
    <p>My chosen archive includes hundreds of maps, showing mine systems, mining bases, and schematics for their improvement or for the construction of new mines. Together, this data allows one to piece together an idea of historical Pittsburgh industry in a specific sense. One item shows schematics for a test site for an experimental blasting process run in part by Carnegie Tech. The Consolidation Coal Company is a corporation responsible for the founding of many of Pittsburgh’s local coal mines. Founded in 1860, the company undertook major operations to exploit large coal deposits both in Pittsburgh and in neighboring states. Through land ownership and exploitation of the aforementioned large deposits, this company turned Pittsburgh into a point of national importance for coal production. An important piece of context, necessary for understanding how this transformation occurred, is Pittsburgh’s placement directly at the intersection of 3 major rivers. “By providing cheap transportation for fuel supplies from the region’s coalfields and for other natural resources such as timber and oil, the rivers played a critical role in the region's industrialization.” Essentially, the rivers make it easy to transport coal or steel to neighboring cities or mills, which is why if you take a moment to observe the activity on the rivers, there’s a fair chance you will see a barge pushing many platforms of coal. Also, if you were to walk around the city, in Homewood, or even in Oakland, for example, you would stand a good chance of walking near a railway, where you can occasionally hear the horns of a train, usually loaded with coal, passing through. Use of the rivers for coal transport went down significantly after the completion of the trans-national railroads in 1869. After this, coal and steel transport became split between railroads running through Pittsburgh or the river system. In some cases, exports were brought to alternate railroad stations via the rivers, then loaded onto trains. While the steel industry in Pittsburgh has shrunk relatively over time, this city accounts for a significant chunk (7% in 2022) of coal production in America, making it important for a Pittsburgh native to be aware of. Furthermore, it’s important to understand that not only was Pittsburgh a leader in coal and steel, but these industries were intertwined with others, like higher education, scientific research, and transportation. Thus, when one industry is driven to advancement, in a way they all are.</p>

  <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
    <p>This is important information from an economic perspective, or maybe for a conservationist, but why is it important for students and faculty at Pitt, or even just your average Pittsburgher going about their business? The answer is because everything that has come together to make the city livable and vibrant was built on that sturdy foundation, and being aware of the foundation over which you are walking will enrich your experiences in the city by allowing you to understand things through the proper lens, or with the proper context. </p>

<!--Let's think a little about what we have learned and how we can apply this knowledge and skills moving forward.-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>How Serious is This Issue?</h2>
    <p>While this issue is not neccesarily of the utmost importance, it doesn't hurt to understand the background. Additionally, for people living in Pittsburgh who care about the long-term wellbeing of the city, this is an important issue. While industries that have lost some significance over time (as large-scale production has been exported) may seem like they have become unimportant, it is worth understanding how much of an effect they have had on the identity of the city.</p>
</div>

  
  <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is The Purpose?</h2>
    <p>The selected archive offers far greater depth into Pittsburgh’s coal-related history than most simple sources. While all of this detailed knowledge is not necessary for achieving our ends, it is interesting. Ultimately, however, our ends are to understand the general role that Pittsburgh plays on the national stage as far as coal production, and to use a knowledge of the city’s industrial history to enrich one’s own experience in the city. Andrew Carnegie and his Carnegie Institute of Technology, The Mellon brothers and the Mellon Institute, which was brought to fruition by Robert Kennedy Duncan to improve “connections between the scientific research of the University (of Kansas) and the applied technology of the factory”, and the Consolidation Coal Company, which today is known as CONSOL Energy Inc., are all important pieces of context if one wishes to understand that foundation that holds up a huge part of Pittsburgh culture. Furthermore, this information is increasingly valuable when you take a look at Pittsburgh’s surrounding area. The Pittsburgh Coal Field is a giant region covering Allegheny, Fayette, Green, and Washington counties. All throughout these regions, the small-town communities based around the mines have built up much of their identity (and employment) on this industrial process. While these are almost exclusively small towns, they become, in the aggregate, a significant portion of Pennsylvania’s working class population. That is another reason why it is important to understand the history.</p>
